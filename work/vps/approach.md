I worked there for 3 years

...

VPS is a small company

accordingly I got the opportunity to work very early in my career to work on a variety of projects

from the vhdl code of the image processing pipeline, over the C code controlling the Microcontroller inside the glasses to the Rust code receiving the data from the glasses and managing the communication to the Web Interface. I touched everything.

The only Software Parts I hardly touched were the actual Web Frontend and the deep mathematics analyzing the images of the eyes.

After knowing everything about the product I got curious to experience new challenges and to move on


------

Used technologies:

Rust (Hyper, Tokio), C/C++ (Microcontroller), Python (FastAPI, AsyncIO), VHDL (Image processing), Embedded Linux (Yocto)
